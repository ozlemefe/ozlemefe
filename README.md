- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ozlemefe
- Our topic is to create store-product demand forecasting with Python.
We have a data set containing 5 years of sales data for 10 different stores and 50 different product types. Our goal is to predict sales for the next 3 months.
Our data set is divided into two. As train and test.
Our data set includes date, store ID, item ID, sales data.
The model we want to use is LightGBM, XGBOOST, RandomForest. We will try to make the most accurate prediction by comparing these models.
